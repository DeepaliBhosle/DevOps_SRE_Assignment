##Why DevOps & SRE is Needed in the Application Release Process

-->DevOps: DevOps practices enhance collaboration between development and operations teams, leading to faster and more reliable software releases. It emphasizes automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CI/CD), which streamline the release process and reduce errors.

-->SRE (Site Reliability Engineering): SRE focuses on ensuring the reliability and performance of applications. It applies engineering principles to operations, aiming to create scalable and resilient systems. SRE ensures that releases maintain optimal performance and stability.


##The Challenges DevOps & SRE Solve

-->DevOps:
i> Collaboration: Breaks down silos between development and operations teams.
ii> Automation: Reduces manual errors and speeds up the release process.
iii> Continuous Improvement: Enables continuous testing and integration, leading to higher quality software.

-->SRE:
i> Reliability: Ensures systems are resilient and can handle failures gracefully.
ii> Performance: Focuses on maintaining optimal performance even during high traffic.
iii> Scalability: Builds systems that can scale seamlessly.


##Tasks and Responsibilities of a DevOps & SRE Engineer
